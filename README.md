# scratch.git

Git integration for Scratch.

This is not intended for stable use, this is just a little dumb prototype! Only compatible on Debian-based distros

## Configuration

1. Set up Git with a proper repository
2. Download TurboWarp Desktop
3. Clone this repository and run `./copy_script.sh`
4. Install Python requirements and run `python3 main.py`

Now you can open up TurboWarp and feel the magic. Just open a project, make some changes, and yeah
