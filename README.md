‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a dumb side project, please don't use this seriously.**

Some people are looking for an integrated version control system for Scratch, so this a first step toward that.

## Usage

Install these things:

- [TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) (in case you didn't read the title)
- [Python](https://python.org/downloads)

After you clone the repo, clone a repo to use for project versioning, rename it to `scratch-git-test`:

```bash
git clone link_to_repo
mv name_of_repo scratch-git-test
```

Then download a Scratch project locally and rename it to `Project.sb3`. Finally, run this:

```bash
./scratch-git
```

This opens `Project.sb3` in the TurboWarp editor and launches the web server to manage commits/pushes. It also copies the userscript to the config folder for TurboWarp to inject stuff.

You should now see a new button labeled "Push changes" which runs pushes code from the backend. The save button in the top-right should also be able to generate commits based on changes that you make to your project.

Congrats, you are now a ü¶Ñ‚ú®~ _**1000x** developer_ ~‚ú®ü¶Ñ, no terminal skills required.

## Commit specification

scratch-git uses a derivative of [Convential Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) which has been adapted to fit Scratch programming.

Changes are done by sprite and are separated by commas.

Commits start with the name of the sprite you are making changes to (e.g. Sprite1, Stage) with a comma afterwards (similar to CC).

Commits then specify the change they are making using one of the following statements:


| Statement  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `add [costumes]`  | The following costumes: `[costumes]` have been added  |
| `remove [costumes]`  | The following costumes: `[costumes]` have been removed  |
| `modify [costumes]`  | The following costumes: `[costumes]` have been edited  |


| Statement  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `{+\|-\|/}{blocks} blocks`  |  `{blocks}` number of blocks have been added (`+`), removed (`-`), or rewritten (`/`)  |

Here's a few examples:

```
Sprite1: +3 blocks, add costume1, Stage: remove backdrop3
```

```
Ball: /12 blocks, add red-ball, Stage: add matrix
```

```
Player: +36 blocks, remove old-player, Cloud: +15 blocks
```
