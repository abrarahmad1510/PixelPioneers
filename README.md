# scratch-git
Git integration for Scratch (TurboWarp)

**⚠️ This is a dumb side project, please don't use this seriously. This is currently for Debian distros only**

Some people are looking for a version control system for Scratch, so this a first step toward that.

## Configuration

1. Download and install [TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/). Once finished you should have access to `$HOME/.config/turbowarp-desktop`

2. Run `./init.sh`

3. Run `./start.sh` to launch a server for the userscript to use

Now you when you make some changes to a project in TurboWarp, just click the save button in the corner! Commit names are decided based on the actual changes you made.
