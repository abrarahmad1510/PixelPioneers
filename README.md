# scratch-git
Git integration for Scratch (TurboWarp)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a dumb side project, please don't use this seriously. This is currently for Debian distros only**

Some people are looking for a version control system for Scratch, so this a first step toward that.

## Configuration

1. Download and install [TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/). Once finished you should have access to `$HOME/.config/turbowarp-desktop`

2. Run `./init.sh`

3. Run `./start.sh` to launch a server for the userscript

Now when you make some changes to a project in TurboWarp, just click the <kbd>Save to your computer</kbd> button in the corner. Commit names are decided based on the actual changes you made.

When you're all done, click the <kbd>Push</kbd> button to push all your commits to your repo.

Congrats, you are now a ü¶Ñ‚ú® _1000000x developer_ ‚ú®ü¶Ñ
